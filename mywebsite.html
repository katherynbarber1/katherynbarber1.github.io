<h1>Katheryn Barber</h1>
<h3>A Student from Florence, South Carolina</h3>
<p style="font-size:20px;">I am a senior that attends <a href="http://www.fcseagles.org/?view=mobile">Florence Christian School</a>,the Florence Baptist Temple,
<a href="https://www.bju.edu">Bob Jones University</a>, and  <a href="https://www.fdtc.edu/">Florence Darlington Technical College</a>. I am also a violinist 
and a violin teacher.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">I have taken violin for eight years and have taught children violin for four years. I play violin in the church orchestra, in the 
school ensemble, and in a private orchestra. I have played the violin in several weddings and have competed and played in several region and state events. I 
love playing the violin. It is a lovely gift the Lord has blessed me with.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">I love music and reading. I spend most of my time studying and working on school and college work.</p>
